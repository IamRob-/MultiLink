# MultiLink - Mystcraft Addon

**REQUIRES MYSTCRAFT**

##Description:
A small and simple Mystcraft addon which adds an item called a Link Holder. The Link Holder holds link pages that are extracted from linkbooks using the Book Unbinder. Shift right clicking the link holder opens the inventory where you can put link pages. Right clicking the link holder opens the book and by using the 'a' and 'd' keys you can navigate to different link pages. Clicking on the link panel teleports you to where the linkbook was created.
